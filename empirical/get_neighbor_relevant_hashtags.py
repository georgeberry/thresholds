What's the ideal dataset look like?

1. Select a couple of hashtags to focus on
1. Create a new database with only ego tweets containing these hashtags
1.
1. For each hashtag:
    1. Get all ego usages of this
    1. Get alters who used this hashtag
    1. Get ego tweet before first usage of hashtag
    1. Sort alter tweets by time
    1. See if exactly 1 alter tweet happened between ego last update
    1. If yes, correctly measured

We need each first usage of a hashtag by the focal node
