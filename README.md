This is an in-progress project by myself and [Chris](https://github.com/chrisjcameron) modeling adoption thresholds for behavior.

The goal is to recover thresholds from empirical data.

## Todo list

1. Extend argument to probabalistic models of thresholds
1. Simplify argument about mismeasurement in models
1. Can we prove something about the direction of bias?
1. Finish simulations
